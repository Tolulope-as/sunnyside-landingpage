## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- Javascript



### What I learned

I learnt so many things regarding css grid and flexbox but i also learnt how to create a responsive navigation menu most especially for mobile screens.
I am proud of this code:


```js
 document.onclick = function(e){
    if (!hamburgerMenu.contains(e.target) && !dropdown.contains(e.target) ) {
      dropdown.classList.remove('open');
      pointer.classList.remove('pointer-active')
    }
  }
};
```
The JS code above can exist the nav menu for mobile screens by clicking outside the menu.

### Continued development
I will love to be able to do more cool and interesting things with Javascript, so i will do well to learn more and most importantly practice.

### Useful resources
- This time i would really say Youtube was very helpful there are more experienced developers there ,I can't remember specifically the youtube channels i visited but just typing out a problem and seeing a video adressing that issue was so helpful.
- I would forever be grateful for stackoverflow,it was also very helpful.
